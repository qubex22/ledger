# ledger
Simple python script to validate and confirm transactions from a csv file. It aggregates the transactions in blocks of 5 tx each. Finally it generates a ledger.csv file with the annotations for the blocks and the transactions that this blocks aggregate (suppose fees for 0.2% for each transaction in a block).
